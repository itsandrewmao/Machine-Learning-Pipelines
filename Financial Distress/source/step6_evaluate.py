# 6. Evaluate Classifier: you can use any metric you choose for this assignment 
# (accuracy is the easiest one). Feel free to evaluate it on the same data you 
# built the model on (this is not a good idea in general but for this assignment, 
#     it is fine). We haven't covered models and evaluation yet, so don't worry 
# about creating validation sets or cross-validation.
